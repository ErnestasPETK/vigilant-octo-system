Dockerization of both applications was not finished therefore the applications need to be run separately:

Django backend:

1. Install pip modules from requirements.txt
2. Make migrations.
3. Runserver on default port (8000)

React frontend:

1. Install packages.
2. Run Dev (npm run dev)

Tests are available for backend only.
